This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a user ID is retrieved from the request parameters without checking for validity.  If an invalid ID is passed, the application throws an error and crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling, preventing crashes and returning informative error messages to the client.
